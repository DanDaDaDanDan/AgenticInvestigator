## How to Use

For EACH framework below, perform DEEP analysis. Not a checklist — actual exploration.

**Minimum:** 200 words per framework. Generate R### tasks for any gaps identified.

---

## PART A: Core Investigation Frameworks (1-20)

### 1. Follow the Money
**Who benefits financially from each outcome?**

- What financial relationships haven't we mapped?
- What payments, contracts, or interests might explain behavior?
- What financial documents MUST exist that we haven't found?
- Who gains if our conclusions are wrong?

### 2. Follow the Silence
**Who is NOT talking that should be?**

- What questions are being avoided?
- What topics cause deflection?
- Who has something to lose by speaking?
- What would we expect to hear that we're NOT hearing?

### 3. Follow the Timeline
**What sequence of events matters?**

- What sequence would change the interpretation?
- Are there suspicious gaps in the timeline?
- What happened JUST BEFORE the key event?
- What decisions were made in what order?
- Do the timestamps make sense?

### 4. Follow the Documents
**What paper trail exists or should exist?**

- What documents MUST exist but we haven't found?
- What paper trails would prove/disprove claims?
- What contracts, emails, records are missing?
- What filings should be public but we haven't checked?

### 5. Follow the Contradictions
**Where do accounts conflict?**

- Where do sources disagree?
- Which contradictions are most significant?
- What would resolve each contradiction?
- Are contradictions explained or unexplained?

### 6. Follow the Relationships
**What connections matter?**

- What connections haven't we mapped?
- Who knows whom, and since when?
- What conflicts of interest exist?
- What relationships preceded the events in question?

### 7. Stakeholder Mapping
**Who has a stake in the outcome?**

- Who are ALL the stakeholders?
- What does each stakeholder want?
- Whose interests are we missing?
- Who has been impacted that we haven't considered?

### 8. Network Analysis
**What networks connect key players?**

- Are there hidden connections?
- Who are the information brokers?
- What organizational ties exist?
- What informal networks might be relevant?

### 9. Means / Motive / Opportunity
**Who could have done this?**

- For each allegation: who had means, motive, opportunity?
- Are there OTHER people who had all three?
- Have we considered all who could have done this?

### 10. Competing Hypotheses
**What else could explain the facts?**

- What are ALL the possible explanations?
- Which hypotheses haven't we tested?
- What evidence would distinguish between hypotheses?
- What's the probability of each hypothesis?

### 11. Assumptions Check
**What are we taking for granted?**

- What are we ASSUMING without evidence?
- Which assumptions would change everything if wrong?
- What are we taking for granted?
- What "obvious" facts haven't we verified?

### 12. Pattern Analysis
**What patterns exist?**

- What patterns have we identified?
- What patterns might we be missing?
- Is this part of a larger pattern?
- Does this fit known patterns of similar situations?

### 13. Counterfactual
**What would prove us wrong?**

- What would prove us WRONG?
- What evidence would we expect to see if our conclusions are wrong?
- Have we looked for disconfirming evidence?
- What haven't we found that we should have found if true?

### 14. Pre-Mortem
**If this investigation fails, why?**

- If this investigation fails, why would it fail?
- What are we most likely to get wrong?
- What would we regret not asking?
- What criticism would future reviewers have?

### 15. Cognitive Bias Check
**What biases might affect us?**

- What biases might be affecting our analysis?
- Are we confirmation-biased toward certain conclusions?
- Are we anchored on early information?
- Are we favoring sources that agree with us?

### 16. Uncomfortable Questions
**What questions are we avoiding?**

- What questions are we avoiding?
- What would we NOT want to find?
- What questions would make subjects most defensive?
- What's the elephant in the room?

### 17. Second-Order Effects
**What are the downstream implications?**

- What are the downstream implications of our findings?
- Who else is affected?
- What unintended consequences might result?
- What does this connect to that we haven't explored?

### 18. Meta Questions
**Why are we investigating this now?**

- Why are we investigating this now?
- Who wants this investigated (and who doesn't)?
- What's the broader context?
- Are we being used for someone else's agenda?

### 19. 5 Whys (Root Cause)
**What's the root cause?**

- For key events: Why did this happen? (5 levels deep)
- What systemic factors contributed?
- What's the root cause, not just proximate cause?
- What conditions allowed this to happen?

### 20. Sense-Making

- Does our overall narrative make sense?
- Are there explanatory gaps?
- What's the most parsimonious explanation?
- Would a reasonable person believe this?

---

## PART B: Domain Expertise Frameworks (21-25)

**Purpose:** Prevent surface-level analysis that misses what experts consider obvious.

### 21. First Principles / Scientific Reality
**What does science actually say?**

- What does SCIENCE say about the underlying subject matter?
- What are the biological, physical, chemical, or technical REALITIES?
- What do peer-reviewed studies actually show (not what marketing claims)?
- What is the scientific consensus in relevant fields?
- Have we consulted primary scientific literature, not just news articles?

**Required:** Peer-reviewed journals, academic textbooks, scientific reviews

### 22. Domain Expert Blind Spots
**What would an expert consider obvious that we're missing?**

- Who are the domain experts for this topic?
- What do they consider common knowledge in their field?
- What would they immediately flag as missing from our analysis?
- What questions would they ask that we haven't?
- What terminology or concepts are we misunderstanding?

**Action:** Search for "What do [domain experts] consider obvious about [topic] that journalists typically miss?"

### 23. Marketing vs Scientific Reality
**Where do claims diverge from evidence?**

- What does marketing/PR say vs what does research show?
- What terms have marketing definitions vs scientific definitions?
- What beneficial-sounding claims lack scientific support?
- What negative realities are being obscured by positive framing?
- Who funded the studies being cited by marketing?

### 24. Subject Experience / Ground Truth
**What does the actual subject experience?**

- For animals: What do ethological studies show about their preferences?
- For people: What do affected individuals actually report?
- For systems: What do operational metrics actually show?
- Are we taking the subject's perspective or only the claimant's?
- What would we find if we directly observed/measured the subject?

### 25. Contrarian Expert Search
**Who disagrees with the mainstream view?**

- Who are the credentialed experts who dispute the mainstream view?
- What peer-reviewed research contradicts popular belief?
- What do industry insiders say privately vs publicly?
- What whistleblowers or critics have raised concerns?
- What inconvenient findings have been downplayed or ignored?

**Action:** Search for "[topic] criticism", "[topic] problems", "[topic] myth debunked"

---

## PART C: Analytical Rigor Frameworks (26-30)

**Purpose:** Prevent superficial analysis by requiring quantitative and methodological standards.

### 26. Quantification & Base Rates
**How big is this really? What's the denominator?**

- What are the actual numbers, not just percentages?
- What's the base rate we're comparing against?
- Is this statistically significant or within normal variation?
- Are we looking at absolute or relative risk?
- What's the denominator? ("10 cases" means nothing without "out of how many")

**Key test:** If we quantified every claim, would the story change?

### 27. Causation vs Correlation
**Are we confusing cause and effect?**

- Is there actually a causal mechanism, or just correlation?
- Could there be reverse causation?
- What confounding variables haven't we controlled for?
- Is this a spurious correlation (both caused by a third factor)?
- What would a randomized controlled experiment show?

**Red flags:** "Associated with" treated as "causes"; post hoc reasoning

### 28. Definitional Analysis
**Who controls the definitions?**

- What key terms are undefined or vaguely defined?
- Do different parties use the same word to mean different things?
- Who benefits from a particular definition?
- Are there legal vs common vs scientific definitions that differ?
- Is scope creep happening with definitions?

**Example:** "Violence," "safe," "natural," "effective" can be defined to support different conclusions

### 29. Methodology Audit
**How was the evidence collected?**

- What methodology produced each key piece of evidence?
- What are the known limitations of that methodology?
- Was the sample representative?
- What biases could be introduced by the data collection method?
- Could we replicate the findings with different methods?

**Check for:** Self-reported data bias, survey framing, observational confounders

### 30. Incentive Mapping
**What incentive structures drive behavior?**

- What do people get rewarded for? Punished for?
- What behaviors do current incentives encourage?
- Who profits from the status quo?
- What perverse incentives might be at play?
- If we follow the incentives, does behavior make more sense?

**Principle:** When behavior seems irrational, look for hidden incentives

---

## PART D: Structural Analysis Frameworks (31-35)

**Purpose:** Examine systemic and structural factors often missed in surface-level analysis.

### 31. Information Asymmetry
**Who knows what others don't?**

- Who has information that others don't?
- How does this information asymmetry benefit certain parties?
- What would change if everyone had the same information?
- Are there deliberate efforts to obscure information?
- What information SHOULD be public but isn't?

**Key question:** Who benefits from public ignorance?

### 32. Comparative Benchmarking
**How does this compare?**

- What are genuinely comparable cases?
- Is this behavior unusual, or industry standard?
- How do outcomes compare to baselines or alternatives?
- What can we learn from how similar situations played out?
- Are we comparing apples to apples?

**Danger:** Cherry-picking favorable comparisons. Actively seek unfavorable ones.

### 33. Regulatory & Institutional Capture
**Who controls the rules?**

- Who writes the regulations?
- What's the revolving door between industry and regulators?
- Who funds the research that informs policy?
- Are enforcement resources adequate?
- What's the track record of regulatory action?

**Indicators:** Regulations favoring incumbents, enforcement targeting small players, industry insiders on advisory boards

### 34. Data Provenance & Chain of Custody
**Where does information originate?**

- What is the PRIMARY source for each key claim?
- How many degrees removed are we from the original data?
- Has information been transformed, summarized, or editorialized?
- Can we trace the chain back to original documentation?
- Is there a game of telephone happening?

**Red flags:** "Studies show..." without citations, circular citation, single anonymous sources

### 35. Mechanism Tracing
**How does it actually work?**

- What is the step-by-step process by which X causes Y?
- Can we identify each link in the causal chain?
- Which links are supported by evidence vs assumed?
- Where could the mechanism break down?
- Is the proposed mechanism physically/legally/logically possible?

**Principle:** If you can't explain HOW something works step by step, you don't understand it
