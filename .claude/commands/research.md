# /research - Broad Topic Research

Conduct deep research on an investigation topic.

## Usage

```
/research <topic>
```

## Task

Research the topic broadly to build initial understanding before asking the 35 framework questions.

## Instructions

1. **Use MCP deep research tools** for comprehensive coverage

2. **Research focus:**
   - Key claims and controversies
   - Named individuals and their roles
   - Organizations and relationships
   - Timeline of events
   - Conflicting accounts or contradictions
   - Scientific/academic perspectives

3. **Capture sources immediately** - Use `/capture-source` for important URLs

4. **Update summary.md** - Write initial findings with [S###] citations

## Output

- Captured sources in `evidence/S###/`
- Initial `summary.md` with key findings
- Leads identified for further investigation

## Next Step

After research, the orchestrator invokes `/question` to apply the 35 frameworks.
