  "content": "# X (formerly Twitter) Rules and Policies\n\n## Core Moderation Philosophy\n\"Freedom of speech, not freedom of reach\"\n\nX allows legal speech, even if offensive, controversial, or harmful (including hate speech and misinformation). Content is not removed based on disagreement, but visibility may be limited.\n\n## Content Removal Categories\n\n### 1. Illegal Content (Permanent Suspension)\n- Child sexual exploitation material (CSEM)\n- Terrorist content and terrorist organization promotion\n- Direct threats of violence\n- Illegal goods and services\n\n### 2. Spam and Platform Abuse\n- Coordinated inauthentic behavior\n- Platform manipulation\n- Reduced visibility or suspension\n\n### 3. Doxxing and Harassment\n- Targeted sharing of private information\n- Severe targeted abuse\n- Content removal and potential account suspension\n\n### 4. Civic Integrity (Limited Enforcement)\n- Election fraud claims (removed only if demonstrably false AND harmful)\n- COVID-19 misinformation (policy scaled back post-Musk acquisition)\n- Labeling or visibility limits applied\n\n## Algorithm Characteristics\n\n### Transparency\nX open-sourced ~1,000 GitHub repositories in March 2023, including recommendation algorithm\n\n### Engagement-Based Ranking\n- Positive signals: Likes, replies, reposts, bookmarks (heavily weighted), follows\n- Negative signals: Mutes, blocks, \"not interested\"\n- Media boost: Images/videos receive ~2x algorithmic boost\n- Premium features: Verified+ users prioritized\n- Reply ranking: \"Healthy conversation\" boosts polite/relevant replies\n\n### Content Prioritization\n- Legal content not filtered from algorithm\n- Low-engagement spam deprioritized\n- \"Manipulated media\" flagged but not removed\n- Unfiltered discourse emphasized\n\n## Enforcement\n- Human moderators + AI systems\n- Appeals process via @Safety\n- Community Notes: Crowd-sourced fact-checking\n- Rate limiting to prevent bot abuse (2023+)\n\n## Post-Musk Changes (2022+)\n- Reduced trust/safety team by ~80%\n- Restored previously suspended accounts (e.g., Trump, Kanye)\n- Rate limits introduced\n- Premium membership perks for higher reach\n- Loosened adult content policy (porn allowed if labeled)\n\n## First Amendment Position\nX positions itself as a \"public town square\" with minimal censorship beyond legal requirements\n\n### First Amendment Reality\n- First Amendment protects from *government* censorship, not private platform moderation\n- Private platforms have First Amendment rights to moderate\n- Visibility limits are not equivalent to bans\n- Section 230 shields platforms from liability for user content\n- No legal requirement for platforms to be neutral\n\n## Compliance with Local Laws\n- EU Digital Services Act\n- Brazil regulations\n- Other jurisdictional requirements",
