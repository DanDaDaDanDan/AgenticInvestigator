# Investigative Data Sources

Deep-web databases and open archives for investigative journalism. These are **publicly accessible but not indexed by general search engines** - you must query them directly.

> **Why these matter**: Search engines only index the "surface web." The vast majority of public records, court documents, corporate filings, and government data live in databases that require direct queries. Knowing where to look is half the investigation.

## Query Strategies

### Finding State/Local Records

1. Start with **SearchSystems.net** - select state, then county
2. Look for: property records, business licenses, court filings, vital records
3. Many require knowing exact name/case number - get that from news first
4. Check state judiciary website for court portals
5. Use **DataPortals.org** to find city/state open data portals

### Tracing Corporate Ownership

1. **OpenCorporates** - search company/person name across jurisdictions
2. Check state **Secretary of State** for local filings (officers, registered agents)
3. For shell companies: **ICIJ Offshore Leaks**, **OCCRP Aleph**
4. Cross-reference with **OpenSanctions** for connections to PEPs/sanctions
5. Check **SEC EDGAR** if any entities are public or have SEC filings
6. Use **OCCRP ID Catalogue** for international registries

### Following Government Money

1. **USAspending.gov** - federal contracts/grants by company or recipient
2. State/city checkbook portals for local spending
3. **ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer** if recipient is tax-exempt
4. Cross-reference with **OpenSecrets** for political connections
5. Check **SAM.gov** for contractor status and exclusions

### Verifying Court Claims

1. **RECAP/CourtListener** first (free PACER mirror)
2. Fall back to **PACER** if not in RECAP (~$0.10/page)
3. State courts: find portal via judiciary website or SearchSystems
4. Note: Many state courts NOT online - may require physical records request
5. Use **Google Scholar** case law for appellate opinions

### Finding Deleted Web Content

1. **Wayback Machine** (web.archive.org) - enter exact URL
2. **Archive.today** - alternative archive
3. **Google Cache** - prefix URL with `cache:`
4. Check if DocumentCloud has the document
5. Social media archives (various tools in OSINT Framework)

### Investigating a Person

1. **OpenCorporates** - what companies are they connected to?
2. **OpenSanctions** - are they a PEP or sanctioned?
3. **ICIJ Offshore Leaks** - offshore connections?
4. **Court records** - any lawsuits?
5. **Property records** via county assessor sites
6. **Campaign finance** - political donations?
7. **Professional licenses** via state licensing boards

### International Investigations

1. **OCCRP ID Catalogue** - find the right database for each country
2. **OpenCorporates** - covers 140+ country registries
