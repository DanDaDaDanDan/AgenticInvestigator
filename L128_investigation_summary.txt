FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. TikTok Project Texas Initiative (2022-Present)
   - Multi-year compliance program to address US national security concerns
   - Goal: Isolate US user data and recommendation algorithm from ByteDance China operations
   - Key claim: US FYP runs separately on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) servers in Virginia/Arizona
   - Disputed reality: Leaked documents show incomplete separation; China engineers retained access to code, data derivatives, and A/B testing until at least Q1 2024

2. Algorithm Isolation Claims vs. Reality
   - CLAIMED: Complete operational isolation with no China engineer access
   - EVIDENCE: Forbes/NYT investigations (2023-2024) show:
     * 100+ ByteDance engineers in Beijing retained "very wide approval" access to US algorithm code
     * Internal tool "Lark Codex" (Slack-like) used to access/debug US code as late as spring 2024
     * Master algorithm in China used to A/B test US versions, with results sent back for tweaks
     * Data access loopholes persisted via VPNs and analytics dashboards through Q1 2023

3. Regional FYP Differences (Operationally Confirmed)
   - Content personalization differs significantly by geography:
     * US: 70-80% local content prioritization, music/dance/e-commerce heavy
     * China (Douyin): 90% local, E-commerce/live-streaming dominant, heavy state censorship
     * EU: GDPR-compliant, stricter privacy, less personalization depth (20% reduction due to consent)
     * SEA: Hyper-localized, K-pop/Bollywood trending, faster trend cycles
   - Technical driver: Geo-sharded architecture with region-specific moderation models
   - Trend propagation: US adopts global trends 2-3x slower post-Project Texas
   - Overlap metrics: Only 20-30% of top US FYP videos appear in EU/Asia feeds

4. Technical Architecture Insights
   - Multi-stage pipeline: Candidate retrieval (2K-10K from 100B+ videos) → Ranking (multi-task DNNs, CTR/engagement prediction) → Re-ranking (diversity/freshness filters)
   - Key signals hierarchy: Watch time (70%), completion rate (60% weight in scoring), interactions, contextual signals
   - Training: Separate US models on US-only user interaction data (170M+ US users)
   - Deployment: Isolated inference clusters on OCI; no cross-region mixing
   - 2024 evolution: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for efficiency, federated learning for privacy, LLM integration for semantic understanding

5. Moderation and Isolation Mechanisms
   - Geographic detection: IP address (primary), GPS, SIM card, language/account settings
   - Content geo-blocking: Videos tagged by creator location; violations hidden regionally
   - 100+ country-specific guidelines with region-specific thresholds
   - Shadowbanning: Low-geo-match content deprioritized algorithmically
   - Bypassable but risky: VPNs work short-term (~20-30% evasion success) but ML detects anomalies

KEY CONCLUSIONS FOR INVESTIGATION
================================================================================

1. TikTok's Project Texas claims operational isolation but leaked evidence shows it is INCOMPLETE
   - Data storage successfully isolated to Oracle US
   - Algorithm code and development REMAINS accessible to China engineers
   - Isolation is more operational (real-time access restricted) than developmental (code/model training shared)

2. Regional FYP differences ARE REAL and INTENTIONAL
   - Not just algorithm isolation; active content geo-blocking and region-specific model training
   - Creates distinct algorithmic monocultures per region
   - Evidence: 20-30% content overlap, different trend propagation speeds, region-specific moderation

3. This lead directly supports the main investigation thesis:
   - MONOCULTURE aspect: Each region gets siloed, locally-optimized recommendations → reduces cross-cultural discovery
   - NICHE FRAGMENTATION aspect: Regional isolation + personalization creates separate algorithmic universes with minimal overlap
   - Regulatory compliance (US Project Texas) actually AMPLIFIES fragmentation by design
