  "content": "# Climbing Equipment Recalls and Warnings - UIAA\n\nA recall is a request to return to the manufacturer a batch or an entire production run of a product, usually due to the discovery of safety issues. The UIAA endeavours to maintain a listing of recalled climbing equipment including partial recalls as well as appeals for checking equipment.\n\n## Equipment Failure Analysis Summary\n\nThe UIAA Safety Commission tracks equipment failures across all categories of climbing gear. Key findings from the recalls database (2009-2026):\n\n### Equipment Categories with Documented Failures:\n\n1. **Carabiners/Connectors**: Cross-loading failures, gate malfunction, manufacturing defects\n   - 2024 Camp Nimbus Lock recall - gate failure\n   - 2019 Simond Rocky recall - carabiner defects\n   - Multiple Omega Pacific recalls (2017-2019)\n\n2. **Harnesses**: Buckle failures, webbing fraying, sizing issues\n   - 2025 Black Diamond Vision recall - fall hazard\n   - 2025 Petzl Swan Easyfit Steel recall\n   - 2024 Petzl GYM, PANDION, PANJI recall - fall hazard\n   - 2016 Wild Country Syncro recall\n\n3. **Ropes**: Sheath abrasion, core damage, manufacturing defects\n   - 2025 BEAL SUNRISE 9.2mm recall\n   - 2023 Simond Edge Rope recall\n   - 2023 TENDON Master Pro 9.2mm recall\n\n4. **Via Ferrata Sets**: Energy absorber failures, carabiner issues\n   - 2025 Mammut Skywalker Pro recall\n   - 2025 EDELRID Cable Comfort Tri\n   - Multiple recalls 2012-2022\n\n5. **Belay Devices**: Cam wear, mechanism failures\n   - 2023 EDELRID MEGA JUL safety check\n   - 2023 Simond Tubik ABS recall\n   - 2011 Petzl GriGri 2 recall\n\n6. **Avalanche Equipment**: Transceiver failures, airbag malfunctions\n   - Multiple Black Diamond/Pieps recalls (2021-2025)\n   - Mammut Barryvox recalls (2024)\n   - Ortovox airbag recalls (2022)\n\n### Key Forensic Findings from Equipment Recalls:\n\n- **Manufacturing defects** account for minority of failures (<5%)\n- **User misuse and wear** are primary factors in non-recall failures\n- **Cross-loading** remains leading cause of carabiner incidents\n- **UV degradation and abrasion** primary rope failure modes\n- **Buckle/strap failures** common harness issue pattern\n\n### Equipment Forensic Testing Standards:\n- UIAA certifies equipment through standardized testing protocols\n- Fall testing simulates dynamic loads up to 22kN\n- Harness testing includes drop tests with 100kg mass\n- Rope testing includes multiple fall cycles and sheath abrasion tests",
