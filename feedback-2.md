## **Rating**

Overall: **6/10**

Breakdown:

* Writing/structure: **8/10** (clear thesis, strong narrative through-line, good sectioning)

* Evidence discipline (traceable sourcing \+ methods): **3/10** (many precise-looking numbers with no auditable dataset or methodology; several placeholder refs not accessible)

* Factual accuracy of checkable details: **6/10** (core historical events mostly right; at least two material claims are contradicted by available sources; several key stats are unverified)

## **Accuracy check of major concrete claims**

| Article claim (paraphrased) | Verdict | Notes / evidence |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| John Bachar died on July 5, 2009 after falling while climbing unroped at Dike Wall near Mammoth Lakes; he was 52 | Verified | Multiple obituaries/profiles report the date, location, soloing context, and age. |
| He died while soloing a 5.9 route | Not verified from reliable primary reporting | I found repeated photo captions identifying “Bachar’s Revenge (5.9)” at Dike Wall, but I did not find a definitive accident report/obituary specifying that the fatal fall occurred on a 5.9 route (or naming the route). |
| Toxicology after Bachar’s death was “clean” | Unverified | I did not locate an authoritative toxicology/coroner source confirming this. (This is the kind of claim that needs an official report or a clearly cited investigative article.) |
| Brad Gobright died while (simul-)rappelling / during a rappelling descent | Verified | AAC accident write-up and other reports describe a rappelling accident at El Potrero Chico. |
| Dan Osman died due to rope failure during a rope-jump (not a free-solo ascent) | Verified | Described in long-form reporting on the incident. |
| David Lama and Hansjörg Auer died in an avalanche on Howse Peak (objective alpine hazard, not soloing mechanics) | Verified | Major reporting identifies an avalanche during their Howse Peak attempt. |
| Michael Reardon was swept away by a rogue wave at Valentia Island | Verified | Reported by eyewitness account and news coverage. |
| Reardon had blood alcohol 223 mg/100ml | Not verified; likely incorrect as written | I could not find any credible inquest/coroner reporting supporting this number. Multiple accounts focus on the rogue-wave event without mentioning intoxication. This should be removed or rewritten with a primary citation. |
| “Wet rock was a myth” in Derek Hersey’s fatal fall; NPS records said “no rainfall” | Contradicted (at minimum, overstated) | Accidents in North American Climbing account discusses rain earlier that afternoon and rock becoming wet/slick as a plausible contributor. Your article’s framing (“no rainfall” → “post-hoc rationalization”) does not match that AAC/NPS-linked narrative. |
| Himalayan Database shows experience reduces fatality risk 20–30% per prior 8,000m summit | Contradicted by a key study using the database | A large retrospective cohort study using Himalayan Database data found increased Himalayan experience was not associated with a change in odds of death after adjustment (OR \~1.00). Your “20–30% per peak” claim is not supported by that analysis and needs correction or a different citation. |

## **The biggest problems are not “small errors”—they’re methodological**

### **1\) Several precise statistics are not auditable**

Examples:

* “AAC recorded 153 free solo deaths (1951–2022)”

* “per-ascent death rate \~1 in 5,000–10,000”

* “free soloing is 100–200× more deadly per ascent than roped climbing”

* “free solo logs \<0.2% of recorded climbs”

* “elite 5.12+ soloists fewer than 1,000 worldwide”

* “bimodal age distribution: 50% \<28, 30% ≥36”

* “87% of true free solo deaths occur during ascent”

* “execution error 25–35% vs objective hazards 15–25%”

I could not verify these from American Alpine Club summaries, published datasets, or peer‑reviewed work in the sources I reviewed, and the article does not show its underlying dataset or counting rules.

What to do:

* Add a methods appendix: inclusion criteria, what counts as “free solo death,” geography (North America vs world), how AAC incidents were filtered, and how you handled duplicates and media reports.

* If you computed “per-ascent” risk, show the denominator logic explicitly (or remove the numeric claim and stick to qualitative risk framing).

### **2\) Some claims conflict internally with the citations you chose**

One example: you cite a paper titled “Age Does Not Influence Maximal Force or Rate of Force Development…” (per your link text), then later assert RFD impairment as a key differentiator. If that RFD claim comes from other aging literature, cite that literature and explain why it should generalize to trained climbers; otherwise it reads as a mismatch.

### **3\) You use a strong “investigative” tone but don’t provide investigatory artifacts**

Terms like “the investigation found…” imply you have a compiled dataset. If you do, the article should provide:

* A public spreadsheet (even a small one) of the analyzed cases,

* Or at least a reproducible description of how counts were produced,

* Or a clear explanation that the numbers are heuristic estimates rather than measured rates.

## **Physiology section: directionally plausible, numerically shaky**

The conceptual distinction you make (max strength vs rapid correction / precision) is reasonable. But several *quantified* claims are presented without a clear source chain or with links that don’t substantiate the specific numbers (e.g., “proprioceptive error increases by 1.5–2 degrees per decade after age 40,” “foot placement variability increases 12–18% per decade”).

If you want to keep the section rigorous:

* Either remove the specific degree/percent figures, or

* Anchor them to a specific joint/task population (knee JPS? cervical JPE? gait foot placement control?) and cite those studies directly, with clear scope limits.

---

## **Recommended corrections (minimal edits that materially improve accuracy)**

1. Replace the Hersey “no rainfall” paragraph with a neutral statement:

* “Contemporaneous reports differ; AAC’s account notes brief rain earlier in the day and suggests wet rock may have contributed.”

2. Replace the “experience shield” numeric claim:

* Either remove the “20–30% per prior 8,000m” number, or explicitly contrast the evidence (including the finding of no net benefit in adjusted models).

3. Remove (or fully source) Reardon intoxication:

* Keep the rogue-wave fact; drop the BAC unless you can cite a primary inquest/coroner report.

4. Downgrade all “precise risk” estimates to qualitative language unless you publish the dataset/methods:

* Given the denominator problem, present ranges as speculative and show how they were derived—or omit.

5. Avoid Wikipedia as a medical/measurement authority for Bachar (injury specifics, grip-strength percentage changes):

* Keep the documented car-crash/spinal-fusion history only to the extent it is supported by reputable reporting.

---

## **Bottom line**

* The article is strong as an essay and as a framing device for “aging \+ cumulative exposure” risk.

* As an “investigation,” it currently overstates what the evidence supports: too many exact numbers without traceable computation, and at least two materially incorrect/unsupported claims (Hersey rainfall framing; the “experience reduces death risk 20–30% per prior 8,000m peak”).
