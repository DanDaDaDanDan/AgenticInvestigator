**ZIZZY:** As former band member of M-Pop (Mexican pop) AQUIHAYAQUIHAY, Zizzy is now venturing on his solo music career. The singer, rapper, writer, and producer has collaborated with artists such as Álvaro Díaz, Easykid, Yng Lvcas, and Jesse Baez, and continues to create his reggaeton, rap and r&b fusions rooted in the Monterrey sound.

**ALEJO:** Alejo gained momentum in 2022 with the release of “Pantysito” in collaboration with Feid and Robi, as well as “Un Viaje” alongside Karol G, Jotaerre, and Moffa. Since 2021, he’s dropped four albums, including his 2024 _Antes De_. Currently, the Puerto Rican urban act is making the rounds with his EP _El Playlist 1._

**LUPITA INFANTE:** One of the acclaimed female voices in _Música Mexicana_ today, Lupita Infante—and granddaughter of the late Mexican icon Pedro Infante—recently unleashed her third studio album called La Corona es Mía.

**JUANITO EL MILLONZUKI:** In 2018, Juanito El Millonzuki (slang for Juanito the millionaire) released his debut studio album called _El Más Perron!_ with 12 songs that toggled from quebradita to cumbia to tribal.

**CHAPARRO CHAUCHENEGER:** The Mexican comedian and content creator rose to fame on social media thanks to his popular and irresistible character “Chaparro Chaucheneger,” which loosely translates to the short \[Arnold\] Schwarzenegger. Chaparro has nearly eight million followers on TikTok and over one million on Instagram.

**GERARDO FERNÁNDEZ:** With a trajectory that spans over 20 years, Fernández has recorded 13 albums rooted in mariachi, banda, and norteño with modern fusions. In addition to being a singer and songwriter, Fernández—brother of Regional Mexican sweetheart Pedro Fernández—is a multi-instrumentalist who plays the guitar, drums, and violin.

**SILVIA ZEPEDA:** Silvia Zepeda stepped into the music industry in 2018 when she participated and made it to the finals of reality show _La Academia_. Two years later, she released her debut single called “No Es La Primera Vez,” captivating with her soulful mariachi vocals. Zepeda, whose debut studio album _Homenaje a los Grandes_ came out in 2023, is making the rounds with her new single “A Ver Si Tu Orgullo,” an upbeat ranchera via Luz Record.
