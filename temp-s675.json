  "content": "# AAC Publications - Accidents in North American Climbing\n\nThe American Alpine Club (AAC) publishes the annual Accidents in North American Climbing report, a comprehensive analysis of climbing and mountaineering incidents in the U.S. and Canada. These reports (dating back to 1951) categorize accidents by cause, including equipment failure.\n\n## Key Statistics on Equipment Failure in Climbing Accidents\n\nEquipment failure accounts for approximately 1-6% of climbing incidents annually - one of the least common causes. Most accidents (70-80%) stem from human error.\n\n### Long-Term Trends (1951-2023):\n\n| Period | Fatal Accidents Analyzed | Equipment Failure % | Common Failure Types |\n|--------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1951-2000 | ~1,200 | ~6% | Rope cuts/abrasion (25% of failures), harness issues, old gear |\n| 2001-2010 | ~450 | ~4% | Carabiner gate issues, quickdraw failures, worn slings |\n| 2011-2020 | ~600 | ~2-3% | Cam lobe failures, rappel device misuse |\n| 2021-2023 | ~250 | ~1-2% | Helmet cracks, belay device jams; most tied to improper setup |\n\n### Recent Annual Data:\n\n- 2023: 128 incidents analyzed, 1 equipment failure (0.8%) - carabiner gate cross-loading\n- 2022: 142 incidents, 2 failures (1.4%) - worn daisy chain rupture, helmet failure in rockfall\n- 2021: 136 incidents, 0 equipment failures as primary cause\n- 2020: 124 incidents, 3 failures (2.4%) - cam extractions, rope sheath damage\n- 2019: 150 incidents, 4 failures (2.7%) - quicklink failure, slings abraded\n\n### Common Equipment Failure Categories:\n\n1. **Ropes**: Sheath abrasion or cuts over edges, core shots from falls\n2. **Protection (Cams/Nuts)**: Placement errors, cams walked out or shock-loaded sideways\n3. **Connectors**: Cross-loaded carabiners or worn gates\n4. **Harnesses/Slings**: Age-related degradation or improper fit\n5. **Helmets**: Impact beyond rating or poor maintenance\n\n### Forensic Analysis Finding:\nModern climbing gear is highly reliable when inspected and used correctly. Failures often involve misuse, wear, or manufacturing defects rather than inherent flaws. 90%+ of equipment-related issues trace to human error.",
